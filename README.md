# LeetCode Exercises with Python

![Python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue.svg)

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of LeetCode exercises, along with detailed explanations and Python code using unittest for testing.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a learning resource for Python developers who are practicing their problem-solving skills on LeetCode. Each exercise includes:

- A clear problem statement from LeetCode.
- A detailed explanation of the problem and its constraints.
- A Python implementation of the solution using unittest for testing.
- A suite of test cases to validate the correctness of the solution.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a LeetCode exercise. Within each folder, you'll find:

- `README.md`: Contains the problem statement, explanation, and the Python implementation of the solution using unittest.
- `main.py`: The Python code for the solution.
- `testing.py`: The unittest test cases for the solution.

## Usage

To run the test cases for a specific exercise, use the following command:

```
python3 -m unittest <exercise_folder>.testing

```

For example, to run the test cases for the "1672_richest_customer_wealth" exercise, use:

```
python3 -m unittest 1672_richest_customer_wealth.testing

```
